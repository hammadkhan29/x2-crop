                                        Gene editing is seen as a safer and less obtrusive alternative to the older technology of genetic modification. With gene editing, a crop has part of its DNA ‘snipped’ out. With gene modification, the crop’s DNA is modified by having a section of DNA added, sometimes from a different species.

The Scottish government’s stance is to protect the ‘purity’ of Scotland’s food and drinks sector. However the Scottish National Farmers union see that excluding gene-edited crops would put them at a considerable disadvantage to their English counterparts...

                                        The scientific notion that very small changes in the Earth’s atmospheric composition could bring about climate change was first identified by physicist John Tyndall in the 1860s. In April 1896, a seminal paper by Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius entitled “On the influence of Carbonic acid in the air upon the temperature on the ground” first predicted that changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels could substantially alter the surface temperature through what is now known as the greenhouse effect.

                                        Homo-Sapiens are estimated to have evolved 300,000 years ago, with our earliest human ancestors dating back two million years. It was not until 1.8 million years ago before we first used fire to cook our food. This technological advance is said to have been a major factor in our development and evolution. Not having to spend valuable  energy on food digestion enabled our brains to develop and evolve into the multidimensional, creative and sometimes slightly esoteric organs of today.
